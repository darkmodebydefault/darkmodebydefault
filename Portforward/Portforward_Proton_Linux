##This is how to setup portwarding on a Debian/Ubuntu system. Since Proton doesn't give you the ability to do so. This assumes you have already updated your distro##

sudo apt install natpmpc

##This will verify the version you are running on your system##
apt policy natpmpc libnatpmp

##To obtain the gateway address##
natpmpc

##Ensure that portforwarding is allowed on the VPN server##
natpmpc -g (IP address of gateway)

##Create a UDP port mapping##
natpmpc -a 1 0 udp -g (IP address of gateway)

##Create a TCP port mapping##
natpmpc a -1 0 tcp -g (IP address of gateway)

##Loop natpmpc to prevent it from expiring##
while true ; do date ; natpmpc -a 1 0 udp 60 -g (IP Address of gateway) && natpmpc -a 1 0 tcp 60 -g (IP Address of gateway) || { echo -e "ERROR with natpmpc command \a" ; break } ; sleep 45 ; done

##CLOSING THE TERMINAL WINDOW WILL CLOSE THE PORT FORWARDING##
